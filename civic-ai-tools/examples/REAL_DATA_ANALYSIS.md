## 🚀 How MCPs Make This Easier

Instead of writing API calls manually, MCP servers enable:

### Natural Language Queries
```
"Show me the top 10 complaint types in NYC 311"
"Compare restaurant grades across boroughs"
"What's NYC's population compared to other cities?"
```

### Automatic Query Generation
- MCP servers handle SoQL query construction
- Error handling and retry logic built-in
- Caching for performance

### Seamless Integration
- Works directly in Claude Code / Cursor
- No need to write API code
- Results formatted automatically
