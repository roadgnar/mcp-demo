# Sprint: Documentation Cleanup & Repo Rename

**Started:** 2026-03-07
**Status:** Complete (except Future: Socrata Collaboration)

## Context

Improving documentation across three related repos for the civic AI tools project. Target audience is civic technologists, government workers, journalists, and students who may not be deeply technical. Also renaming `opengov-mcp-server` → `socrata-mcp-server` to better reflect what the server does and avoid confusion with the company OpenGov Inc.

## Three repos

1. **civic-ai-tools** — Starter project people fork/clone to get started
2. **socrata-mcp-server** (formerly opengov-mcp-server) — The MCP server itself
3. **civic-ai-tools-website** — Demo website at civicaitools.org
